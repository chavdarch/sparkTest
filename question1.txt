Iâ€™d	like	to	see	how	many	players	of	each	rank	are	playing	each	level,	so	I	might	write	a	query	like	this:

SELECT count(*) as num_players, Rank

FROM Players

JOIN Levels ON (Players.Level_ID = Levels.Level_ID)

GROUP BY LevelName;

What	is	wrong	with	this	query,	and	why?		What	would	you	do	to	fix	it?


Answer:

The Rank has to be part of group by. LevelName is mispelled in the group by. We need Level_Name in select too.

Here is how it should look like:

SELECT count(*) as num_players, Rank, Level_Name

FROM Players

JOIN Levels ON (Players.Level_ID = Levels.Level_ID)

GROUP BY  Level_Name, Rank;
